title: Learning data mining with Coursera - Part 1
---

I've always wanted to learn data visualization and data mining, formally. And since I (luckily) work in a place full of data (a big, beautiful library), I figured I could try my hand at a MOOC (massive open online course). And start with unique data that I was familiar with and others didn't have access to.

At first, I felt pitifully slow, probably since I haven't been in school since... awhile now. So committing to a specialization in anything wasn't trivial decision-making for me.

The first class in the Data Mining specialization from the U of Illinois is Data Visualization. My initial reaction to the class wasn't trepidation, but close. Getting beyond the not-knowing-how-to-study-stage filled me with hope. I could see that if I treated spare hours as my time to take notes and do the homework, I would be alright. (There are variables to taking a MOOC that I was concerned with before, things that have turned me off enough to get my money back for previous efforts wasted. Probably the biggest problem for past-me has been the lack of quality control over the syllabus. A course can be very long and in-depth, with practically no real access to support beyond reaching out to other students taking the course.)

But I can see a little bit of light at the end of this tunnel, with my first 'graded' assignment under my belt. And here are some pointers for those who dare try to fly while still sporting downy, stubby wings:

1. Don't set your expectations too high. I.e. remember that this is an online class, with a lot of students who don't speak the English language too well. My first assignment was graded highly by English speakers, terribly by non-English. I know that this is correlation, but Ive had enough corroboration of this scenario to know now that I shouldn't seriously think that everyone's standards are the same, or that they're coming from the same place as me. 
2. Do what you can with the time you have, but don't sweat making all the assignments the best. This goes back to the first point, but to clarify that the time to put into the assignments really only need to satisfy the rubrics. There are no A's, B's, or F's. Really, you can go back to a class if it's failed and do it as many times as you want. The point is to learn, not to compete with the class.
