title: Learning data mining with Coursera: Part 1
---

I've always wanted to learn data visualization and data mining, formally. And since I (luckily) work in a place full of data (a big, beautiful library), I figured I could try my hand at a MOOC (massive open online course). And start with unique data that I was familiar with and others didn't have access to. Yes, I'm a data-elitist!

At first, it felt like a pitifully slow process, probably since I haven't been in school since... awhile now. So committing to a specialization in anything wasn't trivial decision for me.

The first class in the Data Mining specialization from the U of Illinois is Data Visualization. My initial reaction to the class wasn't trepidation, but close. Getting beyond the not-knowing-how-to-study-stage filled me with hope. I could see that if treated spare hours as my time to take notes and do the homework, I would be alright. 

But that doesn't mean everything is hunky dory in Coursera-town. 

There are variables to taking a MOOC that I was concerned with before, things that have turned me off enough to get my money back for previous efforts wasted.

But I can see a little bit of light at the end of this tunnel, with my first 'graded' assignment under my belt. And here are some pointers for those who dare try to fly while still sporting downy, shortened wings:
