title: A new site, now with more cowbell
---

It's pretty scary how fast the internet and computer technologies are changing our world. It's been ten years since I started creating websites for a living, and only five since I really discovered the power of programming. That whole time, I was looking at the pros and cons of the technology I was using to build sites, then applications for clients. It started with HTML, CSS, PHP, then morphed into something greater: Model View * frameworks, coding languages became more OOP-ish, and JavaScript somehow became a full-fledged (albeit ugly), full-stack language. 

I've tried my hand at a variety of web technologies - my own preference is negligable, but I prefer this flat file format for blogging (using Jekyll) and object-oriented coding for business. Ideally, skills should eventually lead to an easier workflow, and more creativity, right? This is a tough thing to find when you're a programmer. But coding demands creative problem solving, I think.

KISS (keep is stupid simple) is the goal of my newest work. And while I'm at it, to have a little (or a lot) of fun.

A majority of this work's an exercise, too. I have typos, a lot. And not all my interests are going to be interesting, since I'll probably use this site to stash my ideas for work and hobbies.

I hope that if someone else is reading this gibberish, you forgive my ramblings and soap-box opinions. I guarantee you, there are millions more like me out there, so I'm especially thankful that anybody cares.

Cheers!
