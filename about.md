Hi.

Ideally, skills should eventually lead to an easier workflow, and more creativity, right? Creativity is a tough thing to find when you're busy. But coding demands creative problem solving. KISS (keep is stupid simple) is the goal of this site. And while I'm at it, to have a little (or a lot) of fun while creating a sketchbook for my workflows. A majority of this site's content will probably be brain-dumps, a stash of my ideas for work and hobbies.

I hope that if someone else is reading this gibberish, you forgive the mess.

Cheers!
