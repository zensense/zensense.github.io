Hallo! 

It's difficult to explain oneself to an unseen audience, and this kind of thing usually makes my palms sweat. I'm not a good public-speaker, you see. 

* I live in and run around the desert. I'm a desert-rat
* I like robots, but only if they're dorky robots. I don't like to be upstanded by an automaton.
* I work for a University library, which is awesome. They have great books. This has to say more about my personality than what I eat. Which is crap.

If you want to reach out & touch me, please see the sidebar to the left.
