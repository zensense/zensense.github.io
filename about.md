Hi.

It's difficult to explain oneself to an unseen audience, and this kind of thing usually makes my palms sweat. Pretty rarely do I have time to build or update my own site. What you see here is a little bit of my free time.  

* I'm a MUT runner in the desert. Therefore, I'm a connoisseur of drinking water.
* I like dorky robots.
* I work for a University library, which is awesome because they have great books.

If you want to reach out to me, please see the sidebar to the left.
