Hallo! 

It's difficult to explain oneself to an unseen audience, and this kind of thing usually makes my palms sweat. I'm not a good public-speaker, you see. And I spend a lot of time castigating myself for not doing the things I want to do. 

I'm really good at being a masochist, spending hours every week rolling up & down mountains. No really, *hours*. 

Finally, I like robots, but only if they're really dorky robots. I don't like to be upstanded by an automaton.

I work for a University library, which is awesome. They have a lot of books. This has to say more about my personality than what I eat. Which is crap.

Finally, if you want to get in touch with me, please see the sidebar to the left.
