title: Code Hammer, Data Hacker, Tinkerer and DIY Advocate

For the last 15 years, I've dedicated my career to morally responsible computer architecture by making safe, reliable, and useful software for education and journalism. I believe technology should only contribute to society and human well-being. The privacy of citizens is one of the most important aspects of good software practice - our tech should not spy on us.

### Work Experience

**University of Arizona Libraries**
2014 - present

As an _Application Systems Analyst Developer, Sr._, I maintain software for the University of Arizona Libraries' Tech Services/Strategies (TeSS) department including learning tools, digital collections, database portals, repository access and metadata analysis, as well as the main Libraries' website. 

**Wick Newspaper Properties**
2012 - 2014

As a _Web Developer, Sr._, I created and maintained web properties and applications for 15 different newspapers, including journalism sites such as the [Frontiersman](https://www.frontiersman.com/) and [The Green Valley News and Sahuarita Sun](https://www.gvnews.com/), and the [Tucson Weekly](https://www.tucsonweekly.com/), of course. I developed a JavaScript library for live newsstand geolocation and status via the then-new Google Tools API, helping to increase the visibility of physical newsstands in towns like Anchorage, AK. I also developed a streetcam integration project to help drivers avoid congestion in small towns, before Google Maps started displaying drive times and traffic updates.

**Tucson Newspapers Incorporated (Gannett Enterprises)**
2008 - 2012

As a _Web Developer_ for the Arizona Daily Star and the Tucson Citizen, I maintained programming for the two high-availability properties. I helped program one of the first real estate finder applications for the newspapers using my own Javascript code that employed the Haversine formula, dramatically increasing the newspaper's clickthru revenue. I also won a cash award for developing an application decreasing the turnaround time of delivery of marketing materials to prospective clientele. When the Tucson Citizen was dissolved, I helped archive over 30 years worth of articles, >100K documents, which myself and many others have since data-mined for numerous projects. I also helped develop the first Daily Star iOS mobile app, which netted the Star >2K app downloads by the middle of 2012.

**Foundry Digital Design**
2007 - 2008

Foundry was my first entrepreneurial venture to profit from my skills as a _Technologist/Developer_. I had ~30 client properties that I developed and hosted, using PHP/Linux/Apache (LAMP). I was one of the original co-founders of the first Tucson Wordpress Meetup, Tucson Digital Arts Community, and what eventually became the first Tucson co-working space at 115 S. Broadway. (We could never get rid of the cockroaches.)
